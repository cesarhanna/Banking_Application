This is a banking application written in Java. It is not for production use and its sole purpose is to educate and help people who are learning Java and want to use a good reference, emphasizing especially on data types and class composition.

It includes the following main features:

  - Creating branches
  - Creating customers in branches
  - Transactions (withdrawal and deposit)
  - Reports printing (branches, customers, transactions, etc)
  - Editing branch name and customer name
The application does not contain an Account class, however, each customer has a unique customer ID which will act as a unique account ID as well.

It is not connected to a database to store and retrieve data. This will be added in a future release.

The output is shown in the console.
